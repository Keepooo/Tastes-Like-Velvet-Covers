# Ordering a Copy
Ordering a Copy can be quite a daunting task for newcomers, but we'll provide some helpful

## Instructions

1. Find a vendor that makes custom CDs, cassettes, or vinyl (scroll down below for options).
2. Go to the Tracklist folder to copy paste the Genius Tracklist or the Leaker tracklist. This is up to personal preference.
3. Choose a cover art folder that matches the type of physical copy that you want to purchase.
4. Download the cover art
5. Provide (or upload) the cover art and audios to the vendor (depending on what type of vendor it is).
6. Checkout with the vendor.
7. Done. You now have your own physical copy of TLV.

**Alternative Steps:**
1. You are able to buy the vinyl / cd sleeve separate from the vinyl / cd if you want to cut costs.

### Option 1: Find a Local Vendor

You can find a local vendor in your city (or the nearest one) and is considered significantly cheaper than online vendors. You can search this up on a search engine by inputting the city and the custom copy vendor (<city> custom vinyl).

### Option 2: Online Vendors

### Option 3: Making the Copy Yourself (CDs / Cassettes)

More rules will be updated soon.
